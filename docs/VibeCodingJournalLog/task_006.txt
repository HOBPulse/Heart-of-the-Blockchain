# Task ID: 6
# Title: Testing, Audit, and Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive testing, security review, and deployment to mainnet.
# Details:
Integration, load, and security tests. Prepare for mainnet deployment.

# Test Strategy:
All tests pass, audit recommendations addressed, successful deployment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Comprehensive Testing Suite Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive testing suite including integration tests, load tests, and edge case scenarios to ensure system reliability and performance.
### Details:
Create automated test scripts covering all core functionalities. Implement integration tests to verify component interactions. Develop load testing scenarios to simulate high traffic and stress conditions. Document test coverage metrics and results. Address and fix any issues discovered during testing. Include regression testing to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality.

## 2. Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Conduct a thorough security audit of the codebase, smart contracts, and infrastructure to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities before mainnet deployment.
### Details:
Perform static code analysis using industry-standard tools. Conduct manual code review focusing on security patterns. Test for common vulnerabilities including reentrancy, front-running, and integer overflow. Implement penetration testing on the application. Verify secure key management practices. Document all findings and remediation steps. Consider engaging a third-party security firm for an independent audit if budget allows.

## 3. Mainnet Deployment and Monitoring Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Prepare and execute the mainnet deployment process, including final configuration, gas optimization, and establishing post-deployment monitoring systems.
### Details:
Finalize deployment configuration for mainnet environment. Optimize contract code for gas efficiency. Prepare deployment scripts with proper error handling. Create a detailed deployment checklist and rollback plan. Set up monitoring tools to track contract interactions and system health. Implement alerts for anomalous behavior. Document the deployment process and outcomes. Establish a maintenance plan for post-deployment support and potential upgrades.
